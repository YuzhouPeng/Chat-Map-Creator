# Converting an OSM (OpenStreetMap) file to an OpenDRIVE file involves several steps, including parsing the OSM data to extract relevant road network information and then mapping it to OpenDRIVE format. OpenDRIVE is a standard for representing road networks primarily used in simulation and autonomous driving applications.

# Here's a basic outline of how you can approach this conversion process in Python:

# Step 1: Parse OSM Data
# You'll need to parse the OSM XML data to extract road-related elements such as ways and nodes. Python libraries like xml.etree.ElementTree can be handy for this purpose.

# Step 2: Map OSM Data to OpenDRIVE
# Convert the parsed OSM data into the OpenDRIVE format, which involves creating elements such as roads, lanes, junctions, etc.

# Step 3: Generate OpenDRIVE File
# Write the mapped OpenDRIVE data into an XML file following the OpenDRIVE schema.

# Here's a simplified example of how you might start implementing this in Python:

import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
import os
import sys

def parse_osm(osm_file):
    tree = ET.parse(osm_file)
    root = tree.getroot()

    nodes = {}
    ways = []
    relations = []

    # Parse nodes
    for node in root.findall('.//node'):
        nodes[node.attrib['id']] = {
            'lat': float(node.attrib['lat']),
            'lon': float(node.attrib['lon'])
        }

    # Parse ways
    for way in root.findall('.//way'):
        way_info = {
            'id': way.attrib['id'],
            'nodes': [nd.attrib['ref'] for nd in way.findall('./nd')],
            'tags': {tag.attrib['k']: tag.attrib['v'] for tag in way.findall('./tag')}
        }
        ways.append(way_info)

    # Parse relations (if needed)
    for relation in root.findall('.//relation'):
        relation_info = {
            'id': relation.attrib['id'],
            'members': [{'type': member.attrib['type'], 'ref': member.attrib['ref'], 'role': member.attrib.get('role', '')}
                        for member in relation.findall('./member')],
            'tags': {tag.attrib['k']: tag.attrib['v'] for tag in relation.findall('./tag')}
        }
        relations.append(relation_info)

    return nodes, ways, relations

def osm_to_opendrive(osm_file):
    nodes, ways, relations = parse_osm(osm_file)

    # Create OpenDRIVE XML structure
    opendrive_root = ET.Element('OpenDRIVE')

    # Create roads based on OSM ways
    for way in ways:
        road_id = way['id']
        road = ET.SubElement(road_network, 'road', {'id': road_id})

        plan_view = ET.SubElement(road, 'planView')
        for node_id in way['nodes']:
            if node_id in nodes:
                node = nodes[node_id]
                ET.SubElement(plan_view, 'geometry', {
                    'x': str(node['lon']),
                    'y': str(node['lat']),

# Explanation:
# parse_osm function:

# Parses the provided OSM XML file (osm_file) using xml.etree.ElementTree.
# Extracts nodes and ways from the OSM data and returns them as dictionaries (nodes) and lists (ways).
# osm_to_opendrive function:

# Calls parse_osm to get nodes and ways.
# Converts the parsed OSM data into an OpenDRIVE XML structure (opendrive_root).
# Saves the generated OpenDRIVE XML to a file with a .xodr extension.
# Notes:
# Mapping Logic: The actual conversion from OSM to OpenDRIVE will require more detailed mapping logic based on the specific elements and tags you want to include in your OpenDRIVE file. This example provides a basic framework that you can expand upon.

# OpenDRIVE Schema: Ensure that the generated OpenDRIVE XML adheres to the OpenDRIVE schema definition. You may need to refer to the official OpenDRIVE specification (available from standardization bodies or research papers) for detailed information on the schema and its elements.

# Error Handling: This example does not include extensive error handling. Depending on your application, you may need to implement error handling for file operations, XML parsing, and data conversion.

# Libraries: Additional libraries or modules may be necessary depending on the complexity of your OSM data and the desired OpenDRIVE output format.

# This example provides a starting point for converting OSM data to OpenDRIVE format in Python. Depending on your specific use case and requirements, you may need to extend and customize the implementation further.
